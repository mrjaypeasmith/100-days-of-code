# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Round 3 Day 0: 1 March, 2017
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Watched about 30 minutes of Brad Traversy's Udemy course on JavaScript and worked on the UI of my weather app. I also cloned this repository, in the Terminal of course, and made a commit.  I really enjoy using the terminal. 

This is actually my thrid round of 100 Days of Code!  I haven't made it to 100 days on my previous attempts.  I hope this might be the round I make it, but in any event, I can see my skills and understanding develop. 

**Thoughts:** I am really enjoying delving deeper into JavaScript. It's like magic!

### Round 3 Day 1: 2 March, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Watched more of Brad Traversy's Udemy course on JavaScript.  Added some extra lines of code to my get weather function.  It's getting easier to navigate around and be creative with it.  Found a great color palette generator. 

**Thoughts:** I think writing out a plan for my projects would keep me from procrastinating.  I use ToDoist to manage lots of other tasks, so will populate workflows there rather than using another app such as Trello - even though I'm sure it's good, I'm going for digital minimialism.

### Round 3 Day 2: 3 March, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made some excellent progress with my Weather App.  I wrote a function to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit, solivng the problem myself.  There is probably a better way to do it (of course jQuery has it built in) but I like it and it works! I also found some excellent icons to use in the app.

I pushed by code to Github and hosted it on Netlify.  It's a winning combination! 

**Thoughts:** I'm falling in love with JavaScript!  I'm should make a cheatsheet for creating repos and adding to them as I sometimes get the order wrong.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
