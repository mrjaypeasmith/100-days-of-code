# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Round 3 Day 0: 1 March, 2017
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Watched about 30 minutes of Brad Traversy's Udemy course on JavaScript and worked on the UI of my weather app. I also cloned this repository, in the Terminal of course, and made a commit.  I really enjoy using the terminal. 

This is actually my thrid round of 100 Days of Code!  I haven't made it to 100 days on my previous attempts.  I hope this might be the round I make it, but in any event, I can see my skills and understanding develop. 

**Thoughts:** I am really enjoying delving deeper into JavaScript. It's like magic!

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
